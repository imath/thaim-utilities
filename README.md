thaim utilities is imath's theme utilites!
==========================================

my "Thaim" theme used to include some features that should be in a plugin, this is the plugin :)
It's a BuddyPress plugin. On my blog, i've used BuddyPress in a 1 guy (me!) community.
The goal is to enjoy BuddyPress member's page in order to replace the WordPress author page.
to display my repos, and backup tweets & my replies on the support forums of my plugins hosted on WordPress.org 
You can see a demo of it in use on my [personal blog](http://imathi.eu)
thaim & thaim utilities are available in french and english.
